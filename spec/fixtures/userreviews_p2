                <div class="text show-more__control">I was not a Bruce Willis fan per say. As a matter of fact, I thought what is this guy from Moonlighting gonna do? Is he gonna make them laugh to death with stupid comments and jokes? <br/><br/>I was not a fan of &quot;Moonlighting&quot; then either, that would come later. In addition I was not thinking, &#39;John McClain&#39; &quot;Hans Gruber&#39; or &#39;John McTiernan&#39; that was my first error.<br/><br/>As I took in the very first minute of the film, I knew, this was going to be radically different than I had imagined. <br/><br/>This movie and John McTiernan&#39;s directing (Also &#39;Preditor&#39;-1987 &#39;The Thomas Crown Affair&#39;-1999) (The Hunt for red October) (Medicine Man)<br/><br/>The way I felt from his genius directing style, that gets you fully involved, stomach wrapped in knots, pulse pounding. He brings out the whole story, not just a &#39;clot&#39; of mindless action and or violence. <br/><br/>He actually led up to the stories climax and didn&#39;t blow it when he got there. I was shocked at this movie, which gets &#39;compared to&#39; all the time with other action and drama movies! Still, after two decades. <br/><br/>Needless to say, it changed the way I felt about movies and film making. From Willis&#39;s flawless performance to master terrorist Hans Gruber, (Rickman) what a truly superb &#39;Villain&#39; &amp; (James Shigeta, Holly&#39;s Boss) the emotion and heart-thumping fear that lead up to the demise of James&#39;s character. The scenery of the towering building and the city itself after dark, under the threat of terrorist activity. <br/><br/>Don&#39;t forget L.A. P.D.-in charge &#39;DeWayne T. Robinson&#39;, (Paul Gleason - God rest his soul -Died May 26, 2006)<br/><br/>I truly looked at film with a whole different view point. I got a copy of the original script, well the 18th re-write or something like that and went, line by line, through the story. It was unbelievable how this movie changed my mind on Movies...as well as Bruce Willis. I just can&#39;t say enough about Die-hard, but I will come to a soft close...but before I do, here is a &#39;spanner&#39; of a thought, originally Willis was not first choice, it was Stallone that they wanted and he turned it down, think on that one! This would not be what it is this way, it would be wholly different with &#39;Sly&#39; at the helm. I will even venture further out, do you know who this was originally written for? -Answer: Burt Reynolds. No kidding.<br/><br/>This is on my all-time list of the best of the best films, bar-none.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">Die Hard is one of the best action movies ever made, the acting is great. Bruce Willis does a great job as the hero John McClane and Alan Rickman does a great job as the villain Has Gruber. The action is fantastic and the effects are amazing.<br/><br/>The plot sees New York Cop John McClane going to LA to see his family since he&#39;s currently separated from his wife Holly, he goes to see her in the huge Nakatomi building. John meets Holly and after an argument in the room John calls his Chauffeur Argyle when suddenly the phone wires are cut, Hans and his men kill the guards and has one of his men disguised as one, they then go to the floor where everyone is and take them hostage. John hears the gun shots and quickly goes through one of the doors. Hans asks to meet the boss of the building and he shows himself then in the office Hans explains to him that he wants the collection of valuable items hidden in the vault, he doesn&#39;t tell him the code so he shoots him.John witnesses this and quickly escapes. John activates the smoke alarm so the fire brigade will come, they see on the computer what floor the alarm was raised on so Hans sends one of his men after John but he kills him and takes his weapon and bag. John then goes to the roof to call for help but Hans and his men hear where it&#39;s coming from so he sends some of his men to get him, the brother of the man John killed wants to personally kill him. After a firefight on the roof John quickly escapes and the police send an officer to investigate, Sgt. Al Powell. At first he doesn&#39;t notice anything but after John throws at body out the window they open fire at his car and once getting to a safe place he calls for reinforcements. The police soon surround them place waiting for the negotiations while John tries to stop them from inside the building.<br/><br/>Die Hard is a classic action movie that should be seen. 10/10</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">On Christmas eve, John McClane(Bruce Willis) is over at his wife&#39;s office party when hi-tech thieves break into said building and look to steal millions of dollars. While collecting hostages in the process, however there is one man who saves the day and it&#39;s McClane in what is one of the greatest action movies ever made. I must admit that i&#39;m shocked it took so long to for me to review this. Over the years this has been in my DVD collection, I try to watch it on TV every time it&#39;s on and most of all I think it&#39;s there with The Terminator,Hunt For Red October and Rocky as the ultimate genre film. The real reason why Die Hard is so great is due to the suspense factor. Sure the action sequences are brilliant and very exciting but what really earns the high marks is just how suspenseful the movie is, it&#39;s one of those movies where the hero actually does the most logical things. Unlike the sequels per say, Willis uses the element of surprise and cunning to fight off the bad guys. Unlike the sequels where he was far more one man army. As it stands I remember seeing Die Hard in theaters and remembering being very skeptical of Willis (He was on that show with Cybil Shepherd) but knew right away after watching Die Hard, that Willis would be a great. However as it stands, this movie is a classic. On the other hand it&#39;s also a rare instance where one might want to buy a special edition DVD for the extras. Also of note is Alan Rickman who is one of the greatest bad guys ever.<br/><br/>* * * * out of 4-(Excellent, A Must See)</div>

NYC cop John McClane (Willis in his star-making iconic role) is visiting LA at Christmas to reconnect with his estranged wife Bedelia who is at an office party that becomes a nightmare when a group of terrorists take over the building led by Hans Gruber (perfect Rickman) a German nutjob out to filch millions in bonds in the vault of the Japanese company.  As the &quot; fly in the ointment&quot;, Willis does his damnedest to stop him at all costs relying on his street-smarts and out-guessing as time ticks away.  Great blend of action suspense and much welcomed humor.   Best bit: Willis plunging from a rooftop attack by the FBI (thinking the disheveled cop is one of the bad guys!) attached to a fire hose and shooting his way into an empty office!  Hair-raising and exhilirating fun for all. &quot;Yippiee-Kay-Ay !!!!&quot; (Dir: John McTiernan)</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">I first saw Die Hard in the late 1980&#39;s and have owned it on various formats down the years and will watch it now and again. One of the main reasons I enjoy it so is because of the iconic place it holds within the action genre. At the time it came out we were mostly served up pumped-up action heroes who happily take on entire armies and win in battles that are mostly a simple matter of good versus evil, where good is US and evil is them (whoever them happened to be at that time). Die Hard manages to be more than that by starting out with a &quot;normal&quot; guy as our hero. Now I won&#39;t pretend that McClane is not an action hero who does extraordinary things but he seems accessible. I particularly like the fact that his first reaction is to run, to call for help form others and that he only faces the terrorists when he has to, rather than going all Rambo on us.<br/><br/>If this approach provides a grounding, the concept also brings the action into a slightly more real environment. The action is more or less confined to the tower and the bad guys limited rather than being a constantly flowing army of stuntmen. Director McTiernan uses the location really well, injecting tension and a sense of claustrophobia that works really well. The action is enjoyable and offers a lesson that modern CGI-heavy action movies can learn from  if you rely totally on technology then you&#39;ll date quickly, if you make the effects serve the action and narrative then you&#39;ll be standing for years. As a result the action in Die Hard feels no less slick or exciting for being almost twenty years old.<br/><br/>Although this is the most important part of the film to get right, I always appreciated the clever subtexts in the narrative. Filmed in the 1980&#39;s, the film is a clever attack on yuppie values in contrast with the blue-collar &quot;man&#39;s man&quot; type. In this way the narrative can be viewed as those seeking more and more wealth getting in the way of those who just want to be with their families. The most obvious attack on the business culture is the aligning of the terrorists and the corporation. Hans and Takagi share taste in suits, education, knowledge and even share the same opening lines (&quot;ladies &amp; gentlemen&quot;); it is not a stretch to see the film suggesting that Takagi may have also shared some of Hans&#39; ruthlessness in his rise to the top. This is also evident from the very start  John does not lose his wife to Hans, he has already lost her to the corporation as she drops his name and had moved away. Indeed such is the films paralleling of these two threats to McClane, that he only rescues Holly from Hans by getting the watch off her wrist  the watch that was specifically mentioned at the start of the film as a gift from the company.<br/><br/>Ellis sees the connection being made even more obvious as he himself suggests little difference between himself and Hans, apart from the gun and fountain pen aspect. Of course with both businessmen being connected to the terrorists in this way, they must also share their fate, and do. Although it has lumbered the film series with a rather poor catchphrase, the discussion of westerns again confirms the contrast between &quot;man&#39;s man&quot; and &quot;new man&quot;  a connection further made by having McClane in his vest, an outfit more befitting a blue collar worker who has his values in the USA frontier rather than the cut-throat world of foreign business. This distain for bureaucracy is also seen in the redemption of Al. Stuck outside the action in the building (handicapped by incompetence) but also desk-bound due to shooting a kid. At the end of the movie he is redeemed by killing Karl in a &quot;quick-draw&quot; style shoot out, freeing him from his desk and restoring his manhood. Again the split between bureaucracy and real workers and again the use of wild-west symbolism.<br/><br/>The cast respond to the strong script and direction by turning in roundly good performances. Willis has not really been better (even in the same character) and his action twist on his Moonlighting character was the making of him. It is Rickman that dominates the film though; like in Robin Hood, he is a delightful sneering bad guy who has great lines and great presence. The support cast is good below them with Bedelia avoiding being just a damsel in distress; VelJohnson a solid &quot;buddy&quot;; Godunov is a real physical threat  even if a few of the other terrorists barely make an impression on the memory. Gleason, Atherton, White and Davi all give a good show as well.<br/><br/>Rightly an iconic action movie then. The action has stood up really well and is delivered within a story that is tense and well paced. The performances suit the material and, if you want it, there is a clever and engaging subtext running across the whole film. I find it hard to fault and you can see why it has had the influence it has had on the action genre over the last twenty years.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">Bruce Willis gives a amazing performance in perhaps one of the best movies of the 1980s. This is an action/adventure movie for the ages. There are a lot of great scenes, including the scene where Bruce Willis leaps off the rooftop and crashes trough the window. I never thought it would be so good when I first saw it, but I was wrong. Don&#39;t miss one of Willis&#39; best films of all time.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">Prepare yourselves for one of the most action packed thrill rides starring one of the best action stars in Hollywood. Bruce Willis is stirring up trouble for the bad guys in &quot;Die Hard.&quot; In the first of three awesome films, he stars as Lt. John McClane, a New York police officer, who has been invited to the wrong Christmas party.<br/><br/>This is an action film for future actors and directors to watch and use as a model because it describes what an action film should contain. I have seen many action films in my life, but this ranks at the top of my list because it has all the right components. Action packed sequences, explosions, special effects and most of all superb performances with excellent dialogue.<br/><br/>&quot;Die Hard&quot; is a movie I will not soon forget because the story is so well crafted. Though there are no twists or curves thrown at the audience, the audience can be assured they will be treated to two hours of non-stop action from beginning to end.<br/><br/>&quot;Die Hard&quot; did not only produce great action and explosions but future stars as well. I am talking about Clarence Gilyard Jr. who now stars in Walker, Texas Ranger and Reginald VelJohnson who starred in the series Family Matters. These two actors were pivotal to this film in their respective roles.<br/><br/>Two other names to keep in mind while thinking of key performers are Bonnie Bedelia and Alan Rickman. I was blown away when I saw the impact they had on this film. It is as if they came in and said &#39;Okay boys, watch out I&#39;m taking over.&quot; They certainly did that; however, nobody could have done better than the impact performer himself Bruce Willis.<br/><br/>On a scale of 1-10; &quot;Die Hard&quot; is given a 100 by yours truly. My only regret would be that the movie ended. I wish there was more to see in this film. I CAN&#39;T WAIT TO SEE &quot;DIE HARD&quot; AGAIN.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">I&#39;m a great fan of Bruce Willis and the fifty odd films which he has starred in, but his role as John McLane in the &quot;Die Hard&quot; series would have to be on the top of my list for the best Bruce Willis movie of all time. After watching and probably enjoying the film immensely, you realize how corny, but good the film was. The first few action sequences involve the ultimate bad guy, Hans Gruber (played by Alan Rickman in one of his more solid performances) and are great viewing. They really do set the tone for the rest of the movie, and even for the sequels to follow. But these first few scenes are upstaged by the brilliance of Bruce Willis in his many fight scenes, usually involving gunfire, glass breaking or some kind of explosion! These scenes are enjoyable and all lead to the explosive finale, which leads to a chopper going down, the roof of a building exploding, and a man falling 70 stories to his death. There&#39;s also plenty of comic relief in this film, with Argyle, McLanes&#39; limo driver, being oblivious to the anarchy occurring above him whilst he is in the underground car park listening to music and chatting up ladies. Officer Powell, McLanes sidekick outside of the building, also provides a few good laughs. But the two main performances of Willis and Rickman take up mos of the screen time, and rightfully so, as these two characters are brilliant to watch. The Plot line is quite good for such an action-packed film, and it doesn&#39;t ever lose any of the intensity it starts out with, if it doesn&#39;t gain any that is! All in all, this is a film I recommend for anyone who doesn&#39;t take films too seriously, or just wants a good action packed film. Definitely one to put into your DVD or video collection at home.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">1988 saw the peak of modern action films. It will be forever imitated but never bettered. White vests and catchphrases at the ready..Its DIE HARD John Mclane is a New York cop, recently separated from his wife Holly. Holly works for a big business company in the heart of California and is celebrating the opening of a new mega-plex building &#39;Nakatomi&#39;. She invites on-off husband to the opening ceremony and his arrival quite nicely co-insides with the arrival of a group of party-spoiling terrorists led by a German named Hans Gruber. Good job he brought his gun then! Directed by John Mctiernan, Die Hard, saw the first and best action film with soul, and a lead hero who wasn&#39;t actually invincible. Struggling with the issues of doing his job, saving his wife, escaping from the building etc, John Mclane comes across as someone who actually has a heart, someone who can be beaten and above all, someone we can genuinely like.<br/><br/>The film follows Mclanes exploits as he scurries around the &#39;Nakatomi&#39; plaza evading terrorist grasp whilst trying to help cops on the outside diffuse the situation. He&#39;s not an Arnie type character whos just there to empty a few clips, he&#39;s simply stuck in the situation and just doing the best he can, which incidentally sometimes isn&#39;t all that much.<br/><br/>There is a particularly good scene where Mclane succumbs to the likelihood that he may never escape alive and in a heartwarming scene, relays a message to a cop on the outside &#39;Al&#39; to pass on to his wife. Fighting tears whilst trying to remove shards of glass from the feet of his broken body, we find that this guy is real. He&#39;s human, and very much destructible. Hence we back his corner more.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis stars as the said cop, elevating him to super stardom from then on. It was a film requiring excellent acting skills over a toned physique and casting was spot on. Alan Rickman plays the terrorist leader Hans Gruber and Bonny Bodelia Mclanes wife Holly. All parts are played superbly, further increasing the immersion.<br/><br/>Now, Die Hard IS still an action film. There&#39;s a lot of explosions, fighting, swearing and heroics but thanks to great scripting, acting and directing, it never becomes clichéd. The pacing is spot on. Scenes of dialogue are freed by a gun-fight and harrowing scenes, followed by hate-fuelled violence. Its got explosions, but never too many, dead bodies, but never dwelled upon, its got swearing, but never for swearings sake and its even got a catchphrase, but even that is believable given the feelings and emotions going through Mclane as he battles for his own life as well as his wife and hostages. And thats the key to its success: Perfect pacing and perfect balance.<br/><br/>This all may sound very deep for an action film, and it probably is, but when you watch it you&#39;ll most probably think..&#39;That was absolutely amazing&#39; and you wont know why. Well this is best an analysis i could make. We sit there and just take for granted how much effort goes on in the background.<br/><br/>Wise people say that &#39;when you&#39;ve done your job right, people wont know you&#39;ve done anything at all&#39; Here here i say.<br/><br/>Yipee-Kiyay! movie lovers</div>

            <div class="content">
                <div class="text show-more__control">1988 and the undisputed number one action star was that Austrian body builder with the funny name with that monosylabic guy from ROCKY in second place . The thing I hated about Arnie and Sly is that their action movies were uninvolving with over blown battle scenes where the good guys never seemed to be in danger of dying . I was also going to bring the James Bond franchise into the conversation but the series became a parody when Bond stopped speaking with a Scottish accent sometime in the early 70s<br/><br/>
DIE HARD is different to the other 80s action fests with John McLane being a fairly believable genre character . Okay he`s two dimensional but that`s got to be one dimension more than John Rambo who only exists to kill a lot of nasty commies so Americans can flock to the cinema . It`s also interesting to note that McLane`s wife is used in the plot which is slightly different from how most action films work out where the hero is normally single , but that`s probably because DIE HARD as more depth to it than many contemparies. Perhaps the biggest difference is that McLane is slightly flawed as we`re shown one scene where the hero gives the bad guys something they want , not something you`d see in a Arnie or Sly movie . I won`t mention the stunts or the tightly written set pieces or how compelling they are because everyone else has beat me to it , except to say that big explosions and gun fights often overwhelm an action movie ( Bond movies are a good example ) but here they occur from the narrative instead of someone cramming them into the script in a vain attempt to thrill the audience . <br/><br/>Normally I`d have a fit that an action blockbuster is well inside the IMDB top 250 but DIE HARD does deserve to be there since it`s the best movie of its type of its era .</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">Exhilarating, thrill to-the-moment joyride that will have you cheering! Tough New York City cop, John McClane (Bruce Willis) travels to Los Angeles on an invitation by a powerful corporate leader to celebrate at a Christmas Eve Party, where McClane&#39;s estranged wife (Bonnie Bedella) is attending. This was supposed to be a peaceful, joyous occasion, but before McClane could reconcile with his wife,internationally based terrorists lead by Hans Gouber (Alan Rickman, in a terrific performance) and his assistant (the late Alexander Godunov in a fine supporting role) hijack the tall skyscraper. Several hostages are killed, and the police and FBI have been called in to negotiate.<br/><br/>What follows is a non-stop spectacle of stunts, explosions, and amazing action cheorography. Hans Gouber has kept several of the patrons hostage, and he assumed only too much that he had tied all the loose ends. However, Gouber and his mercenaries have not counted on McClane to intervene on the action! The stakes are rising though...as McClane&#39;s wife is among one of several hostages captured at this moment.<br/><br/>Don&#39;t count McClane out yet!<br/><br/>DIE HARD is a one-of-kind action movie that has a breathtaking pace and offers plenty of wits between McClane and Gouber. Bruce Willis gives an excellent performance as McClane, the ordinary guy who has entered the wrong scenario at the right time. Alan Rickman made a terrifying villian, Hans Gouber. Bonnie Bedella was annoying but hysterical as a wiseacre ex-wife turned hostage. The direction by John McTieran (PREDATOR, THE LAST ACTION HERO) was not short of being superb and first class.<br/><br/>DIE HARD is one action packed movie that offers thrills, excitement, and plenty of fast paced humor and wisecracks from Willis. The action is fast and furious, and the film pulls enough punches to keep the energy flowing! DIE HARD is simply one of the most cinematic action masterpieces ever. It is often a rarity to see such a white knuckle adventure that keeps you on the edge of the seat throughout the entire film. Bravo!<br/><br/>RATING: ***1/2 out of ****.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">The 80s Gave us many great action movies from The Terminator, Predator and The Road Warrior to Commando, Big Trouble in Little China and Escape From New York. But Die Hard in my opinion is the best of them all. The Main Character is great. He&#39;s relatable and likable and he&#39;s not a superhero, in fact he gets his butt kicked constantly throughout the movie. The Villain is also great. The Late Alan Rickman does a fantastic job playing this character. The action scenes are quite brutal and violent but very realistic. The humour is hilarious with some of the best one liners in cinema history. My only real problem with this movie is some of the supporting characters, mainly the police. Most of them are incredibly annoying and it gets so irritating when they constantly don&#39;t believe anything the main character is telling them about the terrorists. But even with that Die Hard is still my favorite action film of the 80s(And my favorite Christmas movie too).</div>

            <div class="content">
                <div class="text show-more__control">Die Hard still remains, to this day, one of the best action films of all time. Directed by John McTiernan (The Hunt for Red October, Predator) and written by Jeb Stuart (The Fugitive), the story packs a great amount of action and suspense with memorably immortal characters.<br/><br/>The acting: This was the film that propelled Bruce Willis to absolute stardom. Starring as the charismatic Officer John McClane of the NYPD, Willis lacks the Schwarzenegger-esque physique but shows us you don&#39;t need bulging muscles to defeat your foes. Rather, he is presented as the everyday Joe who is thrust into a flurry of German terrorists. His screen presence is strong throughout, with his witty one-liners (Yippy-Ki-yay, motha*****) and believable character development. There are smaller details presented where Willis reveals more of a vulnerable side to him (usually when he is alone) that perfectly contrasts his &#39;cop machismo&#39;. As he barely escapes one threat presented after another, we are reminded that this is a normal guy in a highly abnormal situation.<br/><br/>Another character who absolutely owns his screen time is Hans Gruber, played by an electric Alan Rickman. He gives a spectacular performance as the leader of the terrorists - conniving, intelligent and also has a comical side. His subtly sinister demeanor keeps us on the edge of our seat and we relish his every move. Perhaps that is why Die Hard has succeeded where so many other action films have failed. We are equally engrossed by both the virtuous and villainous figures presented.<br/><br/>The screenplay: Taking place in predominantly one area for the majority of the film, Die Hard delivers one taut thrill after another. The sense of realism and grittiness does not seem too far-fetched, even for an action flick. The explosions are not superfluous and the gore is not unnecessary – it all helps in developing McClaine&#39;s character and shows us the right extent of how chaotic things become for him.<br/><br/>I particularly loved the meta-humor (&quot;This time John Wayne does not walk off into the sunset with Grace Kelly.&quot; &quot;That was Gary Cooper, a**hole.&quot;) And banter was common in this film, whether it being between Hans and John, John and Office Powell. The superb dialogue, acting and direction manage to elevate this film an echelon above its action-film wannabes.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">&quot;Die Hard&quot; is simply put one of the very best action movies that&#39;s ever been committed to film. Absolutely everything about the movie is perfect, or very close to it. Starting with Bruce Willis as the star, who finds himself caught up, totally unprepared, in a &quot;terrorist&quot; situation where a Japanese corporation&#39;s L.A. office building is taken over by heavily armed, highly trained German terrorists (or mercenaries, or maybe just thieves.)<br/><br/>Alan Rickman is an incredible villain in this who steals every scene he&#39;s in.<br/><br/>The best part about this movie is that it is much more believable and realistic than other action movies. He&#39;s a flawed cop, barefoot, and he actually makes mistakes and gets very badly hurt. The good guys aren&#39;t perfect. It&#39;s largely luck as well as his own toughness and ingenuity that get him through each gunfight, and his need to get his wife (who works for the corporation) back from the bad guys. <br/><br/>Incredible story, pitch perfect acting, lots of great comic relief moments (the dad from Family Matters is in it!), fantastic action sequences. This movie is a must see for action lovers!</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">Die Hard is really a work of art. It was one of the most influential action films today. Filmmakers are always trying to make the Die Hard of today. Die Hard is about a vulnerable everyday man trapped in a small restrictive area, and completely outnumbered.<br/><br/>Bruce Willis plays John McClane, a New York cop that is going to LA for his wife&#39;s Christmas party at her work. Meanwhile a team of 13 terrorist, (not 12 like it says) lead by Hans Gruber played by Alan Rickman take over the Nakatomi plaza. Now it&#39;s up to John McClane, the man at the wrong place at the wrong time to stop the terrorists&#39; plot.<br/><br/>The acting from everyone is top notch. Willis is incredibly likable as John McClane and the supporting cast all do good with their roles. But the show stealer is Alan Rickman, who brings a sense of sophistication and class to the diabolical Hans Gruber. He is a guy you love to hate.<br/><br/>One of my favourite things about the Die Hard series is the character of John McClane. I love his attitude, he kind of is a jerk that butts heads with a lot of figures who disagree with him like the police in this movie. But he still cares about people, which is why he became a cop. I love his relationships with the villains which is usually full of teasing, arguing and insulting each other which is always fun to watch.<br/><br/>The film is a excellent blend of very intense moments, gripping drama, great action and stunt work, and a good sense of humour. Die Hard has stood the test of time as one of the greatest action films of all time.</div>

Die hard with a vengeance is better. Live free or die hard is also better. A good day to die hard is also better. But still this is a good movie. It very fast paced. It is not a family which is a good thing. Because family movies suck. People has don&#39;t like this movie are just people who has a hate on for Bruce Willis. See all the Die hard movies.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">Die Hard (1988) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4)<br/><br/>Enjoyable and tense thriller about a group of terrorists (led by Alan Rickman) who overtake a L.A. skyscraper and the only thing keeping them from getting away with their crime is a New York police officer (Bruce Willis) there on vacation. There&#39;s a lot of very good things about this movie but I&#39;ve always thought that the majority of the credit has to go to star Willis. He might not have been a A-list star at the time this was released but it&#39;s easy to see why he became one afterwards. I think what&#39;s so great about him and the character he plays is that we can believe he&#39;s just your typical guy you&#39;d see walking around on the streets with you. That every-day-man quality that Willis has works so well here because of the odds stacked against his character you can&#39;t help but just sit back and enjoy this one person taking out a professional organization. The hilarious one-liners, the smart remarks and the way Willis makes himself know to the terrorists is just classic and we get so many great showdowns that you can&#39;t help enjoy all of them. It certainly doesn&#39;t hurt that you&#39;ve got a strong supporting cast with Rickman being a villain you just love to hate. The coldness RIckman brings to the part is the perfect contrast to Willis&#39; cop and it works perfectly. Reginald VelJohnson, William Atherton, Bonnie Bedelia and Paul Gleason also add great support for Willis to play off of. The action scenes are certainly some of the best you&#39;re going to see and what holds them together so well is the direction by John McTiernan. He perfectly blends the humor, tension and the action but he also gives the film a wonderful pace that keeps it moving at a fast rate. DIE HARD might be far-fetched in what one man is able to do but this really doesn&#39;t take away from any of the fun.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">I praise this movie just because it&#39;s a great action film. And it has great acting which makes it a classic. And so on. John McClane. After watching this movie, that&#39;s a person you would like to become. It starts with John McClane flying into California to see his wife in a tall forty-story skyscraper. He&#39;s a New York cop, and of course he&#39;s confused and disgusted with the California mood and humor. Then the terrorists arrive. Coincidence that it&#39;s the same night John McClane has arrived. John sneaks out unnoticed and tries to save all the Californian hostages and his wife from the death-threatening terrorists. He&#39;s a cop, so he has skill. Another good thing about this movie is that most of it is believable. Some can disagree, but for the most part, it&#39;s pretty realistic. Die Hard is both violent, which is good for this film, has lots of cursing, which some people can find unnecessary, but I think it&#39;s great, and the movie is sometimes humorous. I enjoyed watching this movie, just because it&#39;s good. Just plain good.</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">Now this is what action movies are all about. &quot;Die Hard&quot; stars Bruce Willis as New York officer John McClane, a cop who gets trapped in a high-rise in LA when terrorists come to steal a substantial sum from the building&#39;s safe. He single-handedly ends up defeating the entire team of terrorists. Although the film&#39;s action scenes are great (especially the classic one involving McClane jumping out of the building holding onto a fire hose), it is the interactions between McClane and Sergeant Al Powell (Reginald VelJohnson) and villain Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) that make the movie what it really is. Rickman plays one of the greatest movie villains, as he combines evil with humor, as every villain should. His performance was Oscar-worthy, in my opinion. It&#39;s great dialogue and fun characters that set &quot;Die Hard&quot; apart from most other action movies. Its three sequels are all great too, but this film is still superior. Always in my top 5.<br/><br/>**** out of ****</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">All I can say is WOW....OK, I lied, I can say more.<br/><br/>Die Hard is one of those movies that is all good action and a good plot: something very rarely seen in the action genre, but it does exist apparently.<br/><br/>NYPD Officer John McClane (Bruce Willis) is in L.A. visiting his wife, Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) at her office for a party. However, a band of European terrorists led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) soon storm the place and take everyone hostage, except for McClane. Its up to McClane to stop the terrorists and save the hostages.<br/><br/>Acting-wise, everyone should have gotten an award for their part. Not a single weak performance here, also no unlikable characters, you pretty much appreciate everyone.<br/><br/>Willis&#39; character was the best by far. He was funny, skilled and there was no way you couldn&#39;t like him or at least get a laugh or two out of his comments or sneaky tactics.<br/><br/>There is plenty of action along with enough background to adequately cover everyone&#39;s motives. There are many great scenes too. You will not feel like you wasted your time watching Die Hard.<br/><br/>10/10</div>

            <div class="content">
                <div class="text show-more__control">This is the action movie that redefined the genre, spawned a host of imitations, and launched Bruce Willis to international super-stardom. He also redefined the action hero, along with Mel Gibson. John McLane (Willis) comes to L.A. to spend Christmas with his family and try to reconcile with his wife, Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), who took their children there to advance her career. Why is it that when a woman breaks up her marriage to advance her career it&#39;s admirable, but if a man does it, he&#39;s an insensitive JERK? (Personally, I see this as a prime example of feminist/liberal hypocrisy. Then they have the nerve to accuse MEN of having double standards!) Anyway, he goes to meet her at a Christmas party at her office, and gets mad at her when he finds out she&#39;s using her maiden name. As he&#39;s berating himself in the private room for starting an argument with her, a gang of thieves come in, kill all the guards, cut off all outside communications, take everyone at the party hostage, and try to get the head honcho, Joseph Takagi (James Shigeta), to give them the access code to the security vault so they can steal $650 million worth of bearer bonds. When he tells the ringleader, Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman), that he doesn&#39;t know the access code, which changes every day, Hans blows his brains out, with John hiding in the room watching. We soon come to know that Hans has the most dangerous combination of traits, high intelligence and total amorality. He then proceeds with his plan, which is to PRETEND to be terrorists, because he&#39;s studied the FBI&#39;s terrorist response plan, and intends to use it to help them break into the security vault. I&#39;m not going to reveal much more of the plot. Instead I&#39;m going to discuss how Bruce changed the character of the action hero forever, and showed great acting ability in the process. Previously, action heroes had generally been portrayed as fearless one dimensional characters who were so tough they could go through anything and anybody who stood in their way with hardly a scratch. To give them credit, both Arnold and Sly tried to give some of their characters added depth, but neither of them had really developed the range to be convincing at that stage of their careers. Bruce broke the mold by portraying John McLane as a normal guy who happened to be a police detective caught up in an abnormal situation. At first he&#39;s frightened and tries to get some outside help, but when he realizes the thieves are controlling all outside communication, he uses his brains to become the &quot;..fly in the ointment. The monkey in the wrench. The pain in the a$$.&quot; to both disrupt the thieves&#39; planned timetable and get them angry. Because he knows that the angrier he makes them, the less clearly they&#39;ll be able to think, and the more they&#39;ll concentrate on trying to kill him instead of sticking to their plan. He also knows this&#39;ll give him the chance to whittle down the opposition. He also shows vulnerability, fallibility, frustration, pain, anguish, and determination. He also uses a good deal of profanity, but it&#39;s never gratuitous. He uses it to control his own fear and to put his enemies even further off balance. I understand that Bruce ad-libbed many of his one-liners.<br/><br/>Finally, I&#39;ve only seen one other commenter that got the real point of this movie. John McLane&#39;s primary motivation through all of this is LOVE! All he wants is to get himself and his wife out of the situation alive so they can go home to their children. So the real point of this movie is that true love truly does conquer all! What real man doesn&#39;t hope somewhere in his heart that if HIS woman were in such deadly danger that HE would have the love and the courage of John McLane? That&#39;s what lifts this movie head and shoulders above all the mindless action movies, and makes it not just a guy movie, but a movie a guy can watch with his best girl, and tell her that he loves her enough that HE would run barefoot through broken glass to save her life if he had to. That&#39;s why I consider this movie a masterpiece and rate it at 10/10. Yippie-ki-yay, motherf#&amp;%er!</div>

That is where New York policeman John McClane(Bruce Willis) will spend his Christmas at. At least for the holidays, because his wife Holly(Bonnie Bedelia) is living. The holidays are going fine until a group of European terrorists ruin the fun. After taking himself a shower, John is very maverick decides to take on the terrorists with a 9mm, and barefoot. Normally, police offers are very resourceful, for John he really is. The only contact had to go on is LA Policeman Sgt. Al Powell(Reginald VelJohnson) those two kept in touch, until the menace was over. When they finally meet, New York and LA will never clash again! John&#39;s limo driver Argyle(DeVereoux White) did his part on taking out the computer hacker(Clarence Gilyard, Jr.) This movie is totally non-stop. It was never a dull moment. The music choices were great, and the surprises never stop. A major keeper! 4 out of 5 stars!</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">This is by far the most exciting action movie I have ever seen. There is a lot of shooting and things that get blown up. This movie was Bruce Willis&#39;s first big movie. He stars as John Mcclane a New York cop who flies to LA to see his Wife and kids for Christmas. Then while people are taken hostage by the bad guys Mcclane escapes and starts shooting the terrorists one at a time. My favorite part was when Mcclane throws a chair with c-4 on it down the elevator shaft and a big part of the building blows up. This movie has been copied a lot but is still very fun to watch. Alan Rickman plays the leader of the bad guys and is very scary. I also enjoyed the two sequels and I am really looking to the Fourth one coming out in 2007. A definite 10 out of 10</div>

                <div class="text show-more__control">Bruce Willis is stirring up trouble for the bad guys in &quot;Die Hard.&quot; In the first of three awesome films, he stars as Lt. John McClane, a New York police officer, who has been invited to the wrong Christmas party.<br/><br/>This is an action film for future actors and directors to watch and use as a model because it is what an action film should be. I have seen many action films in my life, but this ranks at the top as it has all the right components. Action packed sequences, explosions, special effects and most of all superb performances with excellent dialogue.<br/><br/>&quot;Die Hard&quot; is a movie I will not soon forget because the story is so well crafted. Though there are no twists or curves thrown at the audience, the audience can be assured they will be treated to two hours of non-stop action from beginning to end.<br/><br/>&quot;Die Hard&quot; did not only produce great action and explosions but future stars as well. I am talking about Clarence Gilyard Jr. who starred in Walker, Texas Ranger and Reginald VelJohnson who starred in the series &quot;Family Matters.&quot; These two actors were pivotal to this film in their respective roles.<br/><br/>Two other names to keep in mind while thinking of key performers are Bonnie Bedelia and Alan Rickman. I was blown away when I saw the impact they had on this film. It is as if they came in and said &#39;Okay boys, watch out I&#39;m taking over.&quot; They certainly did that; however, nobody could have done better than the impact performer himself Bruce Willis.<br/><br/>On a scale of 1-10; &quot;Die Hard&quot; is given a 100 by yours truly. My only regret would be that the movie ended. I wish there was more to see in this film. I CAN&#39;T WAIT TO SEE &quot;DIE HARD&quot; AGAIN.</div>
